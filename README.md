# Data Analyst with Python

This repository contains resources, datasets, and Jupyter Notebooks for learning and practicing data analysis using Python. It covers topics like data manipulation, visualization, and basic analytics workflows.

## Repository Structure

- **notebooks/**: Contains Jupyter Notebook files for working with pandas, numpy, seaborn, and Matplotlib.
- **data/raw/**: Raw datasets for practice.
- **data/processed/**: Cleaned and processed datasets ready for analysis.
- **utils/**: Contains helper Python scripts for analysis.
- **misc/**: Files that donâ€™t fit elsewhere, such as JSON and others.

## Included Notebooks
- `pandas.ipynb`: Learn data manipulation with pandas.
- `numpy.ipynb`: Numerical computation with numpy.
- `seaborn.ipynb`: Visualization with seaborn.
- `Matplotlib.ipynb`: Visualization with Matplotlib.

## Data Files
- **Raw Data**:
  - `Online Sales Data.csv`
  - `data.csv`
  - `sales_data.csv`
  - `height_and_weight.csv`
  - `New Microsoft Excel Worksheet.xlsx`
  - `sample_data.xlsx`

- **Misc**:
  - `Data.json`: JSON data example.
  - `df_excel`: File with unclear format.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open Jupyter Notebook to explore the content in the `notebooks/` folder.
3. Use the data files in `data/raw` for analysis and save processed versions in `data/processed`.

## Future Enhancements
- Add data cleaning scripts.
- Create visualization dashboards.
- Automate data processing tasks using helper functions.
